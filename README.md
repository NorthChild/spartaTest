solutions and function test using unittest module


# solutions.py
- These are the solutions to the tasks, going by memory so i apologise if outputs are slightly different, 
left a bunch of print statements for when i was testing the code etc, left in just in case
- IMPORTANT: you can run this script to test whether or not the solutions give the right output, REMEMBER TO de-comment print statement following the functions
- IMPORTANT: you can de-comment print statements activating the functions to test whether or not the give correct output
- IMPORTANT: to run the testing, make sure to run the 'test_solutions.py' script and rememeber to keep both scripts in the same folder
